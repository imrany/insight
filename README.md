### Insight
Insight is an AI chatbot that allows users to enter prompts using speech rather than text.
It uses **Gemini** under the hood to give back responses with the user can listen to or download a an audio file fo later.

### Why did we chose voice input only rather than both text and voice input
We've noticed a trend in AI chatbot like **ChatGPT** where users interacts with it mainly through text input, this can 
limit people living with low or lack of vision and the elderly. Therefore we chose voice input for **insight**. 
It can be used for assistance with general questions like *What's the recipe of chocolate cake...?* and other genral questions.

We've combine both speech and generative ai to create this program.

### Challenge 
We choose the open category of the hackathon.
#### Open category üåü
    Feeling adventurous? Build anything that combines two or more modalities‚Äîgo wild with your ideas! Whether it's voice-controlled art generators or AI-powered virtual assistants, the only limit is your imagination.

### Features üöÄ
- Speech recognition or input: Using `Web SpeechRecognition`
- Speech output: 
    Using `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` we convert text response to speech (Text-to-speech).
    Using `MediaRecorder` we record it and store it for user to download.

    Why this approach is not compute intensive and cost effective since some processes like text-to-speech is handled on the client side rathen than on the server-side (our side)

- Download audio files: Users would able to store and download audio files of their prompts/question and responses to later.

- Intelligent: We've integrate insight with **Gemini**, with this integration it can response fast and with nearly
accuracy to the subject matter.
